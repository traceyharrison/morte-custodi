                            Dawn bleeds over the town square. The air tastes of smoke and iron. A thousand eyes press on you from the gathered crowd, their faces half-hidden in the rising fog. You do not stand among them, but before them. You have been punished for the crime of magic. Your sentence? <br> <b>Death.</b>

                            Someone moves to the stage and the crowd stirs as the Inquisitors move into place. They form a ring of steel. Helmets gleam, halberds fixed. At their head: the Captain of the Inquisition, voice hard and ceremonial.

                            The alley swallows you whole. Damp stone walls press close, blocking out the dying light of the square. Your breath comes in ragged gasps as Fable and Kit guide you through the maze of narrow passages.

                            Lanterns flare red behind you as Inquisitors give chase, their boots striking like war drums against cobblestone. The sound echoes off the walls, a thunderous rhythm that speaks of death closing in.

                            Fable runs ahead, his cloak streaming behind him like a banner. He leads you, cutting through side streets with the fluid grace of a man who knows every stone and every shadow that haunts the city. Kit stays close behind, movements precise and deadly, scanning for threats as if the city itself were a trap.
                            <br><br>
                            You stumble along with them, smoke still clinging to your lungs and burning as your run, even now sparks still twitch at your fingertips. Remnants of the power that both saved and damned you.
