                Morning light filters through the safehouse once more, but this time something is different. The air feels heavier, charged with an unfamiliar tension. You wake to find Tris already moving between patients in her makeshift infirmary, and there, in the corner bed, lies Ash.
                <br><br>
                Her pink hair spreads across the pillow like spilled paint, and even in sleep, her face is drawn with pain. Her magic pulses erratically beneath her skin, visible as faint shimmer of frost over her skin.
                <br><br>
                You approach quietly, not wanting to disturb her, but as you draw near, her eyes flutter open. They're unfocused at first, then lock onto you with sudden intensity.
